Gradient Descent Visualization in 3D
This project visualizes the gradient descent algorithm on a 3D surface using Python and Matplotlib. It provides an interactive and animated demonstration of how points move along a 3D surface toward a local minimum by iteratively updating their positions based on the gradient.
